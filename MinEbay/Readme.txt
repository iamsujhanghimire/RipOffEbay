					MinEbay
		A miniature, rip-off version of ebay, and in local directory.

This project is a replication of the second hand, resell market - ebay. However, this program utilizes a local directory to save the data and retrieve it. It uses SQLite3 as a database and tkinter as its GUI.

To run the program, simply run the code source in the 'MinEbay' folder inside the 'MinEbay.zip'.

1. You can upload an item by clicking the Upload button, where
	- you can enter the products name, price, category and description
	- you can choose a picture for the product you want to upload
	- YOU NEED TO ENTER EVERYTHING OR ELSE THE PROGRAM CRASHES

2. You can search for an item listed by clicking the Search button,
	- Enter a search term and get the results
	- SEARCH TERM SHOULD BE AS IT WAS ENTERED ELSE THE PROGRAM CRASHES


This is a basic, somewhat buggy program, but we tried out best to implement the things taught in class, plus a few more research.
